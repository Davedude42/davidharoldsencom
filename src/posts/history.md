Long long ago, I had a homepage at `/mapleroad.php?homepage=David%20Haroldsen`.

My middle school taught us some coding, I didn't get much out of the classes, but what they did provide us was amazing: a text box. Everything I wrote in that box showed up on my homepage, fully rendered and accessible to all of my friends. Some people were content with just putting some images in defaultly formatted HTML tables, but I wasn't. I spent hours writing and painfully debugging my misguided, spaghitti code with no indents or syntax highlighting, w3schools being my only guide.

That was 6th grade. Within a year, my code quantity had reached the character limit of whatever database they used, and I couldn't add any more. So, like any 7th grader, I asked my parents for my own website for Christmas, and they bought me a domain name, `landofdavid.net`. My dad installed php and set up a shared folder, and I was off!

Over the years, I wondered how to make the website a reflection of myself. I put little projects I've made on it, and I made the design my own, but only recently did I decide to start writing on it. After all, now that I'm not 13, it's maybe not as big of a deal if some of my life is documented on the internet. I just don't know who in their right mind would want to read this stuff.

##### In Memorium: Landofdavid.net (2017-20??)

You served me well. Although, it really was too bad that GoDaddy already owned landofdavid.com and demanded a ridiculous price for it.
