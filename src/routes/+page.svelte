			Welcome!
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm <span class="font-semibold">David Haroldsen</span>, as you could probably guess from the domain name.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm an upcoming freshman at BYU and I'm majoring in Computer Engineering. To describe myself, I would certainly say I'm a nerd, but I'm also adventurous and enjoy the finer things in life. I'm an Eagle Scout, and, as I say below, I love music, especially singing.
		</p>
		<p>
			A small list of things I love to do includes:
		</p>
		<ul class="block font-IBMPlexMono text-sm ml-4 my-1">
			<li>1 Programming (obviously)</li>
			<li>2 Singing</li>
			<li>3 Riding my bike</li>
			<li>4 Playing board games (Settlers of Catan fav.)</li>
			<li>5 Reading (audiobooks totally count)</li>
			<li>6 Solving the rubik's cube (45 second pr.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			That's a little introduction to me.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to learn about me more professionally, check out my <a href="/about">About</a> page.<br>
			Otherwise, I suggest you check out my <a href="/blog">Blog</a> or play my games on the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Or you could do none of those; I'm just a block of text, not a cop.
