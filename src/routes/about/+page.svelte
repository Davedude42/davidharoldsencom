			I have my own website, this one. I've had it for a long time. I've had it for... what day is it? Friday?.. then.. for 6 years now. I got it as a Christmas gift in 2018, cause of course that's what all 7th graders ask for, hah..

			Over the years, I've wondered how to make this website a reflection of myself. I put little projects I've made on it, and I make the design my own, but maybe I should start writing on it. Now that I'm not 13 it's maybe not as big of a deal if some of my life is documented on the internet. I just don't know who in their right mind would want to read it.
